# Python-Polymorphism-A-Practical-Guide
# Polymorphism in Python

This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates the different types of polymorphism in Python.

## Description

Polymorphism is a core concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. The script in this repository illustrates how polymorphism can be implemented in Python through various examples.

## Features

- **Method Overloading**: Demonstrates how Python handles method overloading.
- **Method Overriding**: Illustrates how subclass methods can override superclass methods.
- **Operator Overloading**: Shows how to use polymorphism to overload operators.
- **Duck Typing**: Shows how the methods can result in finding the type of object.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
     ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Rakshitachadalawada/Python-Polymorphism-A-Practical-Guide.git
    ```
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Python-Polymorphism-A-Practical-Guide


### Running the Script

To run the script and see polymorphism in action:

```bash
python Polymorphism.py
